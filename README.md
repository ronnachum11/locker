# The Locker
The Locker is a robust virtual school assistant to help students of all ages best adjust to the drastically different style of learning presented by the COVID-19 pandemic. With the ability to store times and invitations to classrooms and other class resources, as well as the ability to take notes and keep track of assignments all in one place, The Locker is every student's one-stop-shop for virtual learning. The Locker served over 650 users during its usage.

## Motivation
During the pandemic, students' learning environmentsÂ were dramatically affected. Shortly after schools opened up, students were not only overwhelmed with the idea of online learning itself, but with an influx of textbook links, class links, submission portals, and a variety of other information. Every teacher had their own system and it was hard to manage. The Locker aimed to unify student information.
